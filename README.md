# PAMPAR
A parallel benchmark to evaluate parallel programing interfaces.

There are 13 parallel applications, each parallelized using PThreads, OpenMP, MPI-1, and MPI-2 (dynamic processes creation).

More details and studies on these applications can be found at: https://www.researchgate.net/project/A-Parallel-Benchmark-for-Performance-Evaluation-and-Energy-Consumption-in-Multicore-and-Manycore-Architectures
